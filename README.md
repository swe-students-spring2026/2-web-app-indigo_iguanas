# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

A simple mobile first habit tracker that helps users build small daily habits and visualize streaks.


## User stories

1. As a user, I want to sign up so that I can create a personal account and track my habits over time.

2. As a user, I want to log in securely so that my habits and progress are saved and private.

3. As a user, I want to create a new habit with a name and daily goal so that I can start building consistency in a specific area of my life.

4. As a user, I want to edit my existing habits so that I can adjust goals as my routine changes.

5. As a user, I want to delete a habit so that I can remove habits I no longer want to track.

6. As a user, I want to mark a habit as completed for the day so that I can maintain and grow my streak.

7. As a user, I want to see my current streak and past completion history so that I can visualize my consistency and stay motivated.
